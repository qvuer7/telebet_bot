process of gathering data from betsapi works in a manner:
    1. getting match FI id from sport id and inplay_filter for inplay or upcoming event
       example of url for inplay skipping esport for soccer:
            url = f'https://api.b365api.com/v1/bet365/inplay_filter?token={TOKEN}&sport_id=1&skip_esports=1'
       example of url for inplay with esport mathces for soccer:
            url = f'https://api.b365api.com/v1/bet365/inplay_filter?token={TOKEN}&sport_id=1'

       requests.get(url).json() returns json as dict with each game as separate object, games have following fields:
            -league
                -league name
                -league id
            -home
                -home name
                -home id
            -away
                -away name
                -away id
            -current score
            -betsapi id
            -r id
            -event id
            -FI id
       see json_reader.py games soccer class for proper names of the fields.
       the most important field from previous request is FI id event which is important for further odds info gathering
    2. using following url possible to send a get request and receive a lot of fucking info about the game and ods:
        url example for event id url = f"https://api.b365api.com/v1/bet365/event?token={TOKEN}&FI={game.FI_id}"
        response as well consist of two fields 1 - succes or not, 2 - result, more interesting for us is result field
        which is an array of dictionaries of correspondents types:
            -SC - score, scores columns - info about game like yellow cards, corneres,
